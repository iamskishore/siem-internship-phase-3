# DNS Tunneling - Data exfiltration

##  Scenario Description

## Objective
  Detects unusually large numbers of DNS queries for a single top-level DNS domain, which is often used for DNS tunneling. DNS tunneling can be used for command-and-control, persistence, or data exfiltration activity. For example, `dnscat` tends to generate many DNS questions for a top-level domain as it uses the DNS protocol to tunnel data.
